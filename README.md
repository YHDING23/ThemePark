# Potterworks in Progress
Hello! I am Victoria, and I love Harry Potter. I also love theme parks. You might think i love the original Harry Potter Theme Park, but I don't. It's  a bit boring.

That's how I got the idea to start designing my own Harry Potter Theme Park, currently named POTTERWORKS! I also decided to start a website called Potterworks in Progress so Harry Potter fans (like me) can check out my planning and work. 

Enough of the boring stuff. It's time to start! The first thing will be the basics of HP. Those include a Diagon Alley Shopping place, hogwarts Hopes (a Hogwarts ride tour through the yards), and the Hogwarts Express! These are things easily summarized in the first books's early chapters. The first is Diagon Alley. here's a quick sketch for you!

## Diagon Alley
It will have Ollivanders, and an Owlery, Apothecary, Sweetshop, Weasley's  Wizard Wheezes, Yonko's Joke Shop, and a Celestina Warbeck Concert. Please let me know if I missed anything. Next is Hogwarts Hopes!

## Hogwarts Hopes

It tours right over the Great Lake, in-and-out-of Hogwarts, into Hagrid's Hut, and ends at the forbidden forest. On the way you'll find professors like Severus Snape and Minerva Mcgonagall, firdents like Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, and ghosts like Moaning Myrtle and Nearly-Headless Nick.
