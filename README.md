# Potterworks in Progress
Hello! I am ✨Victoria✨, and I love Harry Potter. I also love theme parks. You might think i love the original Harry Potter Theme Park, but I don't. It's  a bit boring.

That's how I got the idea to start designing my own Harry Potter Theme Park, currently named [POTTERWORKS] ! I also decided to start a website called [Potterworks in Progress](https://github.com/YHDING23/ThemePark) so Harry Potter fans (like me) can check out my planning and work. 

Enough of the boring stuff. It's time to start! The first thing will be the basics of HP. Those include a Diagon Alley Shopping place, hogwarts Hopes (a Hogwarts ride tour through the yards), and the Hogwarts Express! These are things easily summarized in the first books's early chapters. The first is Diagon Alley. here's a quick sketch for you!

## Diagon Alley
It will have Ollivanders, and an Owlery, Apothecary, Sweetshop, Weasley's  Wizard Wheezes, Yonko's Joke Shop, and a Celestina Warbeck Concert. Please let me know if I missed anything. Next is Hogwarts Hopes!

## Hogwarts Hopes

It tours right over the Great Lake, in-and-out-of Hogwarts, into Hagrid's Hut, and ends at the forbidden forest. On the way you'll find professors like Severus Snape and Minerva Mcgonagall, firdents like Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, and ghosts like Moaning Myrtle and Nearly-Headless Nick.

Now it is the last first-book thing: The Hogwarts Express

## Hogwarts Express

One of the Diagon Alley stations is King's Cross, where you can pass through Platform 9 3/4 and jump onto a compartment in the Hogwarts Express. The train will take you 600 meters to the Hogwarts ride. Even if you don;t want to go on the Hogwarts Hopes ride, you will need to take the Hogwarts Express, because the whole other side of the theme park is there!

Now, before we move ontot Book 2's attractions, we have already got the shopping place Diagon Alley, Hogwarts Hopes ride and the Hogwarts Express ride that connects the 2 things. I hope you think that they are Okay attractions.


## Flying Ford Angelia

So, the first 2nd-book attraction is about the weasleys and Mr. Weasley's blue car. That is Right! The Flying Ford Angelia. It's been turned into a roller coaster called The Flight of the Ford Angelia. 

It has a steep camel hump, no loop, and 2 minor bumps. To ride, you'll sit on a driving seat in an enclosed capsule, with lots of silver switches and buttons to flick and press. 


## Whoumping Willow
Right after is the Whoumping Willow! which is not a big suprise. After all, Harry and Ron bump into it int the Flying Ford. The attraction is called the WWW: Wonderous Whomping Willow.

This ride is very bumpy. Riders sit in big brown boxex hestled in the Whomping Willow's unwilling branches. His eyes glow yellow as it jolts you around. Don't mess with this guy, er, tree.
